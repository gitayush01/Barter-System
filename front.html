<p1>The Barter System is a method of exchange where people trade goods or services directly, without using money. It encourages community collaboration, reduces waste, and brings back the traditional way of valuing skills and items. In today’s world, digital barter platforms make it easier than ever to swap what you have for what you need — simply, fairly, and efficiently.
